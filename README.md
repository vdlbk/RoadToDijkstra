# RoadToDijkstra

Some people challenge themselves to become more fitted persons. One of this challenge is called **Road To Saiyan**    
I want to be more efficient when it comes to create algorithms and understand complex stuffs.

I choosed Dijkstra because he is the one I recall the best from my university classes.     
He received a Turing Award in 1972, so we could say that he's like a **Saiyan**
