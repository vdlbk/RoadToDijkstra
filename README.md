# RoadToDijkstra

Some people challenge themselves to become more fitted persons. One of this challenge is called **Road To Saiyan**    
I want to be more efficient when it comes to create algorithms and understand complex stuffs.

I choosed to named it **Dijkstra** because he is the one I recall the best from my university classes. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:     
He received a Turing Award in 1972, so we could say that he's like a **Saiyan**

## Who is Dijkstra

[Long story short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra)

## Disclaimer

I may not intend to create the best algorithms, I'm just a random guy who try do to his best to improve himself. The solutions I wrote may contains errors.
